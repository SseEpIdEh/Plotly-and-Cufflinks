# Plotly-and-Cufflinks

**Plotly and Cufflinks**
Plotly is a library that allows you to create interactive plots that you can use in dashboards or websites (you can save them as html files or static images).

**Installation**
In order for this all to work, you'll need to install plotly and cufflinks to call plots directly off of a pandas dataframe. These libraries are not currently available through conda but are available through pip. Install the libraries at your command line/terminal using:

pip install plotly
pip install cufflinks
